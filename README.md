**[MissNG Code](https://missng-git.github.io/Quiz/)**

Welcome to the MissNG Quiz!

This quiz application was built from scratch and contains a series of multiple-choice questions intended to challenge your pop culture knowledge. This app is capable of running in a browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has been stylished with a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

You will have 3 minutes (or 180 seconds) to answer as many questions as you can. Every correct answer will award you 5 points, and every incorrect answer will deduct 2 points from your score as well as decrease the amount of time you have left! ðŸ˜±
